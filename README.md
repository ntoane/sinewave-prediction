### Time series prediction using MLP and LSTM
There are two models to explore the hyper-parameter configuration and evaluation of different configurations of [MLP](https://github.com/ntoane/sinewave-prediction/blob/main/MLP.py) for predicting simulated [sine waves](https://github.com/ntoane/sinewave-prediction/blob/main/sine_wave.py) of varied complexity and [LSTM](https://github.com/ntoane/sinewave-prediction/blob/main/LSTM.py) for predicting composite sine wave. Experiments are performed in PyTorch.
